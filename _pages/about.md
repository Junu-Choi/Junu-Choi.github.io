I am a graduate student of the **Interdisciplinary Program in Artificial Intelligence (IPAI)** at **Seoul National University**. My research lies at the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Scientific Computing**, with a primary focus on the mathematical foundations of generative models.

Currently, I am investigating **Trajectory Regularization** and **Optimization Theory** to enhance the robustness and controllability of diffusion models and flow matching.
